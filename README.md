Noteable Repositories:
- [Perovskite_Analysis](https://github.com/Clay246/Perovskite-Analysis) - One of my notebooks from my internship with Oak Ridge National Laboratory; in it, I compare the results of a curve fitting analysis on a hyperspectral cathodoluminescence dataset with the results of non-negative matrix factorization and a variational autoencoder applied to the same dataset.
- [mplanimations](https://github.com/Clay246/mplanimations) - A module I created to add some nice features to animations created in matplotlib (the animation below, along with many others, was created in part using this module)
- [CrystalGraphs](https://github.com/Clay246/CrystalGraphs) - A tool for graphing multiple repitions of the Bravais Lattices (my profile picture, the diamond crystal structure, was created using this)
- [guitar_fourier_transform](https://github.com/Clay246/guitar-fourier-transform) - Plotting the Fourier transform of audio data I recorded with a microphone and my acoustic guitar to see the relative amplitudes of the overtones on each string
- [All-Animations](https://github.com/Clay246/All-Animations) - A collection of animations I've created with mplanimations
